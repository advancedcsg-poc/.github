Welcome to the Advanced POC organisation. 

It has been created to hold all of the POCs that we undertake and keep them seperate from core/production code.

This should help make them easier to identify and also help stop POCs turning into production solutions.

To get started with a new repository please use the template @ <https://github.com/advancedcsg-poc/template-poc-general>.
